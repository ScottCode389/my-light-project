		<p>Our travel agents have visited many of the U.S. lighthouses and have first-hand knowledge about the lighthouses, as well as the surrounding areas... lodging, dining, available tours, additional places to sightsee, and the best beaches around.  Each month we choose 3 lighthouses to highlight under our favorite places to go.  <span class="highlightTeal">We'd love to hear about your favorites.</span></p>
